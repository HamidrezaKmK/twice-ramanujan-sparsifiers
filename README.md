# Twice Ramanujan Sparsifiers

Based on the paper [Twice-Ramanujan Sparsifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/0808.0163) we have implemented a spectral sparsification algorithm that produces graphs with the number of edges being almost linear.

You can check out the full description of the algorithm on the [repository website](https://hamidrezakmk.github.io/twice-ramanujan-sparsifiers/docs/).
